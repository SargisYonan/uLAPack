  5.  Developer License.
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, a Developer License
      can be granted on an individual basis. The purpose of the Developer 
      License is to allow the use of this Work in a development environment to
      decide weather this Work can assist in the creation of a commercial 
      product. A Developer using the Developer License may use this Work and
      Source form for development purposes within a corporation, company, or
      individually with the intent of redistributing an Object form or 
      Derivative Works.

      The Developer License is a permission granted to a Developer to use the 
      Source or Work in a development environment, and not for commercial use by
      any medium. A redistribution agreement must be made in order to grant the
      ability to redistribute the Work, Derivative Work, or Object form. The
      Developer may not make a profit by redistributing this Work, Derivative
      Work, or Object form in any way, without a redistribution agreement.

      The license does however allow a Developer to develop Derivative Work with 
      the intention, to commercially produce Derivative Work and Object forms 
      of this Work in any medium. 

      A single Developer License may only be granted on a single individual 
      basis for a single payment to the Licensor agreed upon by both You and the 
      Licensor.

  6.  Free License.
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, a Free License is
      granted to an individual using this Work for the creation of Object forms
      and Derivative Works for Personal and Private Use. Under no circumstances
      may a corporation, company, academic institution, an individual developing 
      a product, or an affiliate with the intention of redistributing on behalf 
      of a corporation, company, academic institution use the Free License. A 
      Developer License must be granted for such cases. The Free License will 
      only grant the use of this Work for academic purposes, including but not
      limited to research and publication (only by citing the creator of the 
      Source), and self-learning purposes. The Free License is not allowed for 
      any product development purposes.

  7.  Submission of Contributions. 
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, a Contributor may
      have rights to monetary compensation subject to a contractual agreement 
      between the Licensor and Contributor decided upon, and signed by both 
      parties, within no more than one week (7 days) upon Contribution to 
      this Work. A Contributor will not be granted the Copyright License, unless
      explicitly defined in a mutually signed agreement (contract) between both
      the Licensor and Contributor.


  8.  Trademarks. 
      This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

      reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and 
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  9.  Disclaimer of Warranty.
      Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor

      "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
      express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  10. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  11. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
